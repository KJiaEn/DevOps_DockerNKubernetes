# DevOps Docker and Kubernetes

# Docker Concepts
## Docker
- Open source platform
- Build, ship and run any applications anywhere based on containers
- Package applications with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit
- Allows multiple containers to run on the same host operating system
- Drives containerization, microservices, and cloud-native
